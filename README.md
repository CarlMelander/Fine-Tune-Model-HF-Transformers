# Fine-tuning a Language Model with Hugging Face Transformers

This script demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained language model using the Hugging Face `transformers` library along with the `datasets` library. It includes loading models, tokenizing datasets, setting up training arguments, and initializing the trainer for model training.

## Requirements

- Hugging Face `transformers`
- Hugging Face `datasets`
